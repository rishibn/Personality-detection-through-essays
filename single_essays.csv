"""Motherhood means seeing each of my children as individuals, loving them as equals, respecting them as little people.  It means not seeing their imperfections as permanent flaws, but as opportunities to learn more about themselves.  It means showing them my own imperfections, while trusting that they can also learn from me and become better than I ever hoped to be. Motherhood means giving life to a life unlived, it means dreaming of things yet undreamed, and sustaining hope in a hopeless world.  It means untiring prayer in exhausting circumstances; it means choosing to love them when my children are unlovable, and leading them through a wilderness of sin when all they can see is a godless generation before them.  It means showing them god in that godless world, and remaining faithful when my own and their faith is failing. Motherhood entails an absolute acceptance of who each of my children are, a firm spiritual guidance in an evil and ungodly world, and an unconditional love and forgiveness when I am disappointed in their words or actions.  It confirms to me that life is not without hope, that the future is in Gods hands, and that my life will continue when I have gone on to heaven to be with Christ. Motherhood is the greatest gift God gave to womankind, to know that we are instruments in  Gods Creation, to know that we participated in Gods purpose and plan. Motherhood is life, and hopes, and dreams; it is failures and disappointments, repentance and forgiveness.  It is perseverance in parenting a new people for jesus, overcoming lifes trials through Christ who overcame the world, and showing the next generation how to overcome the world by the word of their testimony and by the Lamb of God.  It means sharing the truth of Christs redemptive plan to a new generation that they may go unto all the world."""
